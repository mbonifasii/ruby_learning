equal?

=end

!
not
=end


# Examples of Ruby Comparison Operators

# puts "Equal To Operator:"
# puts 10 == 20

# puts "Not Equal To Operator:"
# puts 40 != 20

# puts "Greater than Operator"
# puts 100 > 20

# puts "Less than Operator"
# puts 10 < 20

# puts "Less than Equal To Operator"
# puts 2 <= 5

# puts "Greater than Equal To Operator"
# puts 2 >= 5


# Examples of Ruby Logical Operators

# Variables
# a = 10
# b = 20
# c = 30

# using && operator
# if a == 10 && b == 20 && c == 30
# 	puts "Logical AND Operator"
# 	puts result = a * b * c
# end

# # using || operator
# puts "Logical OR operator"
# if a == 10 || b == 20
# 	puts result = a + b + c
# end

# # using ! operator
# puts "Logical Not Operator"
# puts !true
