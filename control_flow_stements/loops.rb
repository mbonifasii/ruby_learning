## Loops

# Ruby program to illustrate 'while' loop
# variable x
# x = 4

# using while loop
# here conditional is x i.e. 4
# while x >= 1
#     # statements to be executed
#     puts "Ruby is cool"
#     x -= 1
#     # while loop ends here
# end


# Ruby program to illustrate 'for'
# loop using range as expression

# i = "Sudo Placements"

# using for loop with the range
# for a in 1..5 do
#     puts a
# end

# Ruby program to illustrate 'do..while'loop
# starting of do..while loop
# a = 0
# loop do
#     puts "Ruby is cool"
#     a += 1
#     # using boolean expressions
#     if a.eql? 5
#         break
#     end
# end

# Ruby program to illustrate 'until' loop
# var = 7

# using until loop
# here do is optional
# until var == 11 do
#     # code to be executed
#     puts var * 10
#     var += 1

#     # here loop ends
# end
